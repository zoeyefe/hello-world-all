## 💡 Features

1. We have made all the files output the same sentence - which is "Hello world!" - to make it simple to understand them.
2. All the languages we added is <u>programming languages</u> and there's not one markup language or others (we counted the scripting languages as well).
3. Simple and straightforward codes, to be understandable and readable for any developer - using that language.
